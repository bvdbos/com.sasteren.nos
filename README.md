# NOS Streams

Fetches video URLs for NOS streams

With this app there's tags with the URL's for the latest video-streams which can be used with Chromecast (cast a Video-URL).
Since chromecast version 3.1.1 leading spaces are automatically deleted so dragging tags became easier.

v 1.1.0 (1-11-17):  
* only 'NOS Journaal', 'Nieuws in 60 seconden', 'Nieuwsuur', 'NOS Jeugdjournaal', some streams are behind a geo-filter.  
* Refactored some code...  
* Dutch language  

v 1.0.0 (31-10-2017):  
* initial commit
