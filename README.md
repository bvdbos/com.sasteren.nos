# NOS Streams

Fetches video URLs for NOS streams

With this app there's tags with the URL's for the latest video-streams which can be used with Chromecast (cast a Video-URL).

After dragging a tag there's a space in front of it, you have to delete that space.

"News in 60 seconds" and some others not working atm. Needs investigation...
